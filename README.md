# Discovery Team task test


Attached is a sample Apache log-file. Using standard command-line tools, parse the file to produce the following:

- The top 10 IPs making the most requests, displaying the IP address and number of requests made
- The top 10 User agents making the most requests - possibly normalizing those
- Top 10 requested pages and the number of requests made for each
- Percentage of successful requests
- Percentage of unsuccessful requests
- Top unsuccessful page requests
- The total number of requests made every minute in the time period covered
- For each of the top 10 IPs, show the top 5 pages requested and the number of requests for each

For bonus points, please explain what you think is going on in this log-file. For extra bonus points, generate an ASCII bar-chart showing the number of requests per minute For super extra bonus points, write a script that would do this every hour and generate a html report.  Reply by email with your command lines used to generate the above reports
